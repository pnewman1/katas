Kata #2

Notes:
1. I didn't do this over five consecutive days
2. The first one missed the point of the program, though it does technically work
3. My approaches: 
  i) chop2.py iterate until the value is found, or you hit the top or bottom of the array
 ii) chop3.py same thing, except with a recursive function
iii) chop4.py iterate until the list size is 0, reducing by half each time
 iv) chop5.py same iterator as iii, but finds the index of the array by calculating the fraction of where you are in the array, and multiplying that by the array size 
  v) chop6.py similar to iv, but with a fixed number of iterations defined at the beginning
4. What else could be done? More recursion, more functions, more closures.
5. Which works the best? I kind of like chop5.py
